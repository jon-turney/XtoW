TODO for XtoW
=============

new features

* we always have access to full contents of window (when mapped), so previewing, thumbnailing, etc. works correctly
* we have access to a window pixmap with alpha channel, so windows are composed into native desktop

features missing compared to XWin's integrated WM

those that probably need libxcwm support:
* Convert icon found in icon property to native icon for window
* SHAPE extension support
* Change the native cursor to the X cursor image when it's over an X window
* WM_DISPLAYCHANGE should use RANDR to change the display size
* multiple native screens should be known to XINERAMA
* the ability to ring the bell
* accelerate OpenGL? (requires cunning plan)

those that just need writing:
* 'keyhook' option, so we can catch all keypress and consider if we want to process them, rather than only
getting the ones that the windows shell isn't using (e.g. Windows key, Menu key, Alt-Tab)
* 3 button mouse emulation (if anyone actually needs this anymore...)
* Set the X keyboard configuration to match the native one
* Synchronize the X server modifier key state with the native one at startup, and whenever an X window gains focus (as modifiers might have been latched or unlatched without us noticing)
* Faster way of getting the bits onto the screen than GDI BitBlt() (e.g. DirectDraw)

other stuff:

* lcwm doesn't adopt any existing windows when it starts
* lcwm doesn't understand about InputOnly windows (probably should just ignore them)
* support the _NET_WM_WINDOW_OPACITY property using layered windows on XP, even if we can't use alpha

* Libraryize the code which is currently copied out of the Xserver
- Initially, make it a library in the xserver codebase, so we can share it?
- XWin on MinGW is going to be around for a while, and I don't need the maintainance headache

* Implement -version command line option
