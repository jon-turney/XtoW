TODO for XtoW
=============

goals:

* use xcb
* not built into server
* use native composting

new features

* we always have access to full contents of window (when mapped), so previewing, thumbnailing, etc. works correctly
* we have access to a window pixmap with alpha channel, so windows are composed into native desktop
* interleaving of native and X windows in Z-order should work correctly
* update WM without restarting X applications or server (for faster development :-))
* fixes punch-through?
* separate window message pump thread, so we can update window during modal loops (e.g. resizing)

features missing compared to XWin's integrated WM

those that probably need libxcwm support:
* Convert icon found in icon property to native icon for window
* SHAPE extension support
* Change the native cursor to the X cursor image when it's over an X window
* WM_DISPLAYCHANGE should use RANDR to change the display size
* multiple native screens should be known to XINERAMA
* the ability to ring the bell
* accelerate OpenGL? (requires cunning plan)

those that just need writing:
* 'keyhook' option, so we can catch all keypress and consider if we want to process them, rather than only
getting the ones that the windows shell isn't using (e.g. Windows key, Menu key, Alt-Tab)
* 3 button mouse emulation (if anyone actually needs this anymore...)
* Set the X keyboard configuration to match the native one
* Synchronize the X server modifier key state with the native one at startup, and whenever an X window gains focus (as modifiers might have been latched or unlatched without us noticing)
* Faster way of getting the bits onto the screen than GDI BitBlt() (e.g. DirectDraw)
* -hostintitle option to add WM_CLIENT_MACHINE to window title, if not localhost
* Override window style settings using a config file (useful?)
* set native application id from class hint for native window grouping

other stuff:

* libxcwm doesn't adopt any existing windows when it starts
* libxcwm doesn't understand about InputOnly windows (probably should just ignore them)
* libxcwm doesn't looks at _MOTIF_WM_HINTS (maybe only hints we get from old motif applications?)
* libxcwm assumes window properties are constant while mapped; this isn't true; for every property it looks at, it should also listen for changes to that property
* support the _NET_WM_WINDOW_OPACITY property using layered windows on XP, even if we can't use alpha

* Libraryize the code which is currently copied out of the Xserver
- Initially, make it a library in the xserver codebase, so we can share it?
- XWin on MinGW is going to be around for a while, and I don't need the maintainance headache

* Implement -version command line option

* xcwm doesn't really take advantage of xcb async in all places

native compostion notes (08/11/11):

- DwmEnableBlurBehindWindows()
- UdpateLayeredWindow() - compose in a src bitmap with alpha channel; use for window position/size change as well for maximum rendering performance
- SetLayeredWindowAttributes() - sets an alpha value for whole windows

* XtoW needs to use libxcwm style conversion
* Need to use RENDER rather than XCopyArea() to access image to ensure we get alpha???

* Need to store bits so we can draw them for WM_PAINT without having to ask server..
(xcwm_image_copy_full() to get the full window image, but do we need to do this on init map, or will whole window get damage?)
(Or would using UpdatedLayeredWindow() avoid that need...)
